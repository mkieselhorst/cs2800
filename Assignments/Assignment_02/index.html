<!-- Important Notes [Please Read]:
        In this assignment, you are presented with the challenge of formating an HTML page while adhering to a specific constraint: 
        You are not allowed to change the structure of the elements within the <body> tag of the page, i.e. adding elements or classes or ids.
        It is essential to preserve the existing structure of the elements within the <body> exactly as they are.
        Failure to comply with this constraint will result in the nullification of points for your assignment. 
        Rubrics will not be applied, and you will receive a score of zero for the assignment.

                    <p>
                        Honey bees, a remarkable species of insects known for their vital role in pollination and honey production, undergo a fascinating journey from birth to adulthood. The life cycle of a honey bee begins when the queen lays an egg in a honeycomb cell. The egg hatches into a tiny larva, which is meticulously cared for by worker bees. Worker bees feed the larva with a mixture of pollen and nectar, known as "bee bread," which provides essential nutrients for their growth. As the larva continues to feed and grow, it undergoes several molting stages, shedding its skin and developing into a pupa. During this pupal stage, profound changes occur, transforming the pupa into an adult bee. Finally, after a period of development, the fully formed adult bee chews its way out of the wax cell, emerging as a mature bee ready to take on various roles within the hive, such as foraging for nectar and pollen or tending to the queen.

                    <p>
                        Within a honey bee hive, the queen bee holds a position of utmost importance. She is the largest bee in the colony, measuring about one and a half times the size of worker bees. The queen's primary function is to lay eggs, ensuring the continued survival of the hive. In a single day, a productive queen can lay hundreds or even thousands of eggs. This exceptional egg-laying capacity is vital for maintaining the hive's population and stability. Additionally, the queen produces pheromones that regulate the behavior and development of the other bees in the colony, helping to maintain harmony and order within the hive. Her role as the hive's central reproductive organ is critical, making her a true matriarch in the intricate social structure of the honey bee colony.
